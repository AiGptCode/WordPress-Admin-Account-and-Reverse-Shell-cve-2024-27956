## WordPress Admin Account Creation and Reverse Shell

This Python script automates the process of creating a new administrator account in a WordPress site and executing a reverse shell on the target server. It utilizes the wp-automatic plugin's CSV injection vulnerability to execute SQL queries on the WordPress database and gain administrative access.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)
- Netcat (for setting up a listener to connect to the reverse shell)

## Usage

1. Replace the `domain` variable in the script with the URL of the target WordPress site.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Once the script is executed, it will create a new admin user named `eviladmin`, set the password, and assign administrative privileges.
4. It will then upload and execute a reverse shell payload on the target server.
5. Set up a netcat listener to connect to the reverse shell using the specified port.

**Note:** Ensure that you have proper authorization and permissions before running this script, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities and legal consequences if misused.
